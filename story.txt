Story

The Bible is full of stories about brave and strong women. Have you heard about the beautiful queen Esther?

A long time ago, in the Persian Empire, the brave king Ahasuerus was looking for a wife. The king ruled over many lands, including the land of the Hebrew people. One day he saw and fell in love with a Hebrew girl named Esther.

But Esther had a secret! Nobody knew that she was Hebrew! Many people in the Persian Empire harbored distrust and hatred towards the Hebrews. That is why Esther’s brother, Mordecai, had told her not to tell anybody about her real identity.

So, King Ahasuerus and Esther got married and lived a very happy life. But their happiness was short-lived.

One day, the king’s assistant, Haman, made a plan to kill all the Hebrew people. Fortunately, Mordecai discovered the plan on time and sent word to Esther to save her people.

It was a difficult time for the Queen. She knew that if she told the king about her Hebrew heritage, she could lose her life. But it was a risk she was willing to take!

So, Queen Esther went to the king and proposed two grand feasts! This made the king very happy. But the night before the feast, the king discovered that long ago, Mordecai had saved his life!

Next day, the king rewarded Mordecai. During the feast, Esther, the brave queen, very humbly asked King Ahasuerus to save her and her people. But instead of being angry, the king did just that! He put the evil Haman to death and saved the Hebrew people! All thanks to the brave Queen Esther! This is an interesting old testament Bible story for kids to learn.
